Turning a photo from day to night in seconds. Restoring missing parts of objects in images – like a bite taken out of cake. Seamlessly merging multiple photos into a single, cohesive result. These are the kinds of creative capabilities that once required professional skills or hours of editing. Now they're about to become possible in minutes, directly from a phone, by simply asking in your own words.

Mobile cameras are moving beyond capture alone and the latest Galaxy AI experiences bring advanced creative capabilities together in one intuitive place, unifying capture, editing, and sharing into a seamless experience. The result is a more fluid creative process – eliminating the need to switch between apps or navigate complex tools, so creativity feels faster, simpler, and more natural.

At the core of this evolution is the belief that creativity should not be limited by technical skill or experience. From shooting to editing, the phone camera has quietly redefined what's possible. Now anyone can create cinematic movies, track stars across the night sky, or capture richly detailed photos – even in low light. And with natural, multimodal input, editing becomes as easy as using a few words to express what you have in mind.
